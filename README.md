step 1:

## Set Up GitHub Repository
The first step in our CI journey is to set up a GitHub repository to store our Python application's source code.

step 2:

## Configure AWS CodeBuild
In this step, we'll configure AWS CodeBuild to build our Python application based on the specifications we define. CodeBuild will take care of building and packaging our application for deployment.

step 3:

## Configure AWS CodeDeploy
in this step.we will configure AWS CodeDeploy to automate the deployment of a Dockerized Flask application to an Amazon EC2 instance as part of an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline.


step 4:

## Create an AWS CodePipeline
In this step, we'll create an AWS CodePipeline to automate the continuous integration process for our Python application. AWS CodePipeline will orchestrate the flow of changes from our GitHub repository to the deployment of our application.
